## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- TEXT ALIGN ONLY APPLIES TO BLOCK CONTAINERS
- It is ideal for images to be in containers so that they are responsive
- Buttons are a little tricky as flex items as they can take up the entire height if there is not enough width

### Continued development

- How to correctly position background imgs
